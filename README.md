# phd-scripts
Scripts I have been hoarding during my Ph.D. finally put into a repository (yay!). Each folder contains scripts I have used for a specific work. Do NOT expect beautiful, well structured and properly commented code. There are some instances of proper programming, but as these are scripts I built over the years and just for my, or a very reduced group of people's use, they can be a pain to look at, so come with no guarantee at all. That being said, feel free to use, modify, distribute and butcher every single file in this repository as needed. And of course, feel free to contact me too if you have any doubt about them.
